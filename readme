This is k-means clustering where the number of clusters is given by the user.
No cluster validity indices is used here . The program will ask for the number of clusters. 
In case you have labels in your data, it must be in the last column. 
If the data is 2D(i.e,having only two features), the program will automatically plot the raw data points, and the clusters in different colors.
